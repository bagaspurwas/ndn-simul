Parameter:
- Interest/Second: 10000 (scaled from 100,000,000, 1/10000)
- Payload Size: 1024
- Cache Size: 2048
- Link Speed: 1Mbps/512Kbps (Scaled down from 10Gbps, 1/10000)
- Max link queue: 10 (Scaled down from 100,000 1/10000)
- Delay: speed of light/distance


Steps:
- Run the simulation using default metric collector
- After the simulation is finished check for the result in defined folder
- Run python script to visualize the data using pandas and matplotlib
  The python scripts are included in the project folder
- Identify each node graph for each parameter simulated (rate, delay)
- Save the graph with the most significant difference between IP and NDN
